Docker compose was causing me too many errors, so I decided to swap to ansible. This playbook is heavily inspired by the [ansible-nas](https://github.com/davestephens/ansible-nas) project. Go check it out!

## What Infra does

You can configure Infra to set up any (or all!) of the below on your home or cloud server.

If you have a spare domain name you can configure applications to be accessible externally to your home LAN too; they'll be configured with a sensible hostname and DNS gets updated accordingly if your home IP address changes.

## Preconfigured Application Stacks

Infra application stacks are a number of applications deployed together and preconfigured to perform a common goal.

* Media - Mount a media server with sonarr, radarr, bazarr, jellyfin, etc.

## What This Could Do

Infra can run anything that's in a Docker image, which is why Portainer is included. A server configuration can be a pretty personal thing based on what you download, what media you view, how many photos you take...so it's difficult to please everyone.

## What This Doesn't Do

Infra doesn't set up your disk partitions, primarily because getting it wrong can be incredibly destructive. That aside, configuring partitions is usually a one-time (or very infrequent) event, so there's not much to be gained by automating it. Check out the docs(incoming) for recommended setups.
